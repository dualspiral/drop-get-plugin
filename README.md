# Drop Get plugin

I have no intention of publishing this, [this is simply for another project's use](https://github.com/spongepowered). Creates an inspection: "Drop Get" under Probable Bugs (because I'm lazy and can't be bothered to put it elsewhere) that removes the `get` prefix from a method and lowecases the next letter.

I'm also too lazy to change any metadata on here!

MIT licence applies to the src/ subdirectory - everything else (pretty much) comes from the template...
